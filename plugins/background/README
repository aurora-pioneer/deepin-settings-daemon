This is adapted from the original background plugin.
the original background plugin checks whether Nautilus 
is drawing the background and the desktop icons 
if true, the background plugin does nothing;
otherwise, the background plugin itself draws directly on
the root window.(though to draw or not to draw can be controlled
by a gsettings key)

Rationale:
because we have a 'desktop' application
and we want to draw background in 'desktop', both are
not the desirable behavior. 
another reason is we want to provide some customized background
features. the original background uses GnomeBG from libgnome-platform
which is insufficient.


the current plugin just sets the relevant properties on the 
root window and generates frame pixmaps when cross fading is
in effect. the actual drawing is delegated to other applications.
when the background changes, we notify them by firing PropertyNotify 
events on the root window
